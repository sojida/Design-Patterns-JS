# Singleton Pattern

This pattern ensures that only one instance is created across the application. The application has access to the state and resources of the singleton instance ensuring that no other instance is created and resourecs and state are not shared or altered. The singleton provides methods that accept request to send, store or retreive from its state. This pattern violates the Single Responsiblitiy Principle i.e an object must do one thing/have a single responsiblity.

Singleton is useful for the following:
- to restrict the amount of instances created for an oject
- provide global access point for other classes/objects in the application


NB: Some of the problems that a singleton solves can also be solved with other techniques.
